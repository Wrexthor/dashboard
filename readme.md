# simple dashboard with weather, rss and date/time

weather widget is from https://weatherwidget.io
rss parser is from https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser
background can be changed by replacing img1.jpg or changing the path in index.html
rss just need a new url (or several) (rss2 is the one being used, for another feed box uncomment rss1 and use style.css to position it)

Everything is provided as is, i made this for personal use.
